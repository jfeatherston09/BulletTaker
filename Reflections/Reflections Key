Each team member creates a reflection markdown file in the Reflections directory.
These markdown files are well-formatted. Each team member records their thoughts 
throughout the project, including difficulties, surprises, and lessons learned. 
These files all demonstrate introspection and were maintained each sprint over the course of this project.

### Sprint 1:
Figuring out who would/can do what was still a bit hard to revise. Creation of the player needed to be redone with new code or passed to another team member. I basically completed the background for the main stage. 
I feel like focus needs to be improved for some team members. 
### Sprint 2:
Hopefully have what everyone can/will do planned out. Enemy creation going well besides the problem with the Tween node that no longer exists. A bit of hard times when we were missing some team members but nothing too
difficult.
