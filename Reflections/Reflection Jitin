=## [Jitin ENTER LAST NAME HERE]
### Sprint 1:
created the sprite for the bullet ammo. I think I helped team a lot, and I locked in, making a decent sprite in just a day. One thing I need to improve for my next sprint, is to not be on my phone, so I can lock in more. 
### Sprint 2:
I was given the objective of making a death screen, which has two parts, the leaderboard, with a scoring system, and ranks, with local storage. And also "A please enter your name" section. 
I decided to focus on the Please enter your name part. Although I struggled a little bit, I managed to work it out, and I believe the Please enter your name, will be finished in the middle of Sprint 3.
After that I should lock, in and improve my finding skill on google, so that I can somehow make a local leaderboard, hopefully my teammates will get the scoring variable
### Sprint 3:
