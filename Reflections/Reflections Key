Each team member creates a reflection markdown file in the Reflections directory.
These markdown files are well-formatted. Each team member records their thoughts 
throughout the project, including difficulties, surprises, and lessons learned. 
These files all demonstrate introspection and were maintained each sprint over the course of this project.

### Sprint 1:
Figuring out who would/can do what was still a bit hard to revise. Creation of the player needed to be redone with new code or passed to another team member. I basically completed the background for the main stage. 
I feel like focus needs to be improved for some team members. 
### Sprint 2:
Hopefully have what everyone can/will do planned out. Enemy creation going well besides the problem with the Tween node that no longer exists. A bit of hard times when we were missing some team members but nothing too
difficult.
### Sprint 3:
I have made big progress with the enemy with basically the formate for the rest of the waves. I feel that it may be difficult to add more enemies. I did overlook some spelling which caused problems. I hope that by next
sprint we have a lot more completed.
### Sprint 4:
adding more enemies ws easier than originally thought. Had some trouble fixing menus. Needed to rewrite entire scenes and scripts. I hope that we have some reseblence of a game by next sprint.
### Sprint 5:
killing enemys was created to be smoother than originally thought. Hod to get some help to fix the code in a way I couldn't have. I hope the rest of the team is able to get the fundimentals done.
### Final Thoughts:
This project was fun and I wish I could work as hard as I did on this project on my game. Dispite this there were some difficulties and could have gotten more done with more time. I hope to have learned how to manage time better
the next time I do something like this.
