### Sprint 1: To be honest, I didn't get too much done this sprint. I was able to make a pause menu, as is it was probably on the easier side of requirements, but I mssed the first couple of days, so some of the immediate stuff I should've had to do
was done for me by a couple of people. I suppose I'm satisfied with how much I got done with in this sprint, as things always usually start out pretty slow. I'm hoping things will pick up from here.

### Sprint 2: We forgot to document stuff until the 3rd sprint after going through our sprint retro and checking the rubric, so I'm writing about this, looking back on what I did like 3-4 weeks ago because this is both after the break and
halfway through the 3rd sprint. That being said, I don't really remember anything about this sprint, other than me struggling to implement a movement system. I genuinely can't remember a thing about this sprint other than that, so
and it's kind of hard to draw a lesson from that.
